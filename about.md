Hi, my name is TJ Maynes and Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer at VMware Pivotal Labs. I believe that agile software methodologies, such as pair programming, test-driven development and continuous delivery, are tools that help teams deliver valuable software to their customers.

## Expertise
- Built software on many different agile software teams and projects using tools and frameworks like Kotlin/Spring, Typescript/React, Javascript/ExpressJS/Nodejs, Swift/Objective-C, Clojure, Elixir, Python and HTML/CSS.
- Test-driven development, pair programming and implementing inclusive mob programming sessions.
- Automating software delivery using tools like git, GNU Make, Bash scripts, Docker and Kubernetes.
- Automated testing strategies, such as e2e, integration and unit tests using tools like CypressJS, Jest, and Spring testing framework.
- Strangling legacy systems, object-oriented and functional programming patterns, and finding metrics to drive technical decisions.

Currently, spending more time learning Kubernetes, Istio and making patches with softsynths.
